Important notes for packaging Go applications:

1. Use buildGoModule for Go modules (Go 1.11+)
2. vendorHash management:
   - Set to lib.fakeHash initially, then update with the correct hash from build error
   - Use null if the project has no vendor dependencies
   - Use lib.fakeHash for new packages to get the correct hash
3. Common ldflags patterns:
   - "-s": Strip symbol table
   - "-w": Strip debug info
   - "-X main.version=${version}": Inject version info
   - "-X package/path.Variable=value": Set build-time variables
4. CGO considerations:
   - Set env.CGO_ENABLED = 0 for static binaries
   - Required for cross-compilation
   - Some packages may need CGO enabled for C dependencies
5. subPackages: Specify which packages to build (e.g., ["cmd/myapp"])
6. Build tags: Use tags = ["tag1" "tag2"] for conditional compilation
7. Shell completions:
   - Add installShellFiles to nativeBuildInputs
   - Use postInstall to generate and install completions
   - Check if app supports --completion flag
8. Version checking:
   - Use doInstallCheck = true with custom installCheckPhase
   - Or use versionCheckHook from nixpkgs
9. For applications with assets/templates, may need to copy them in postInstall
10. Cross-compilation usually works out of the box with Go
