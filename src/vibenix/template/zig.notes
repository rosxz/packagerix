Important notes for packaging Zig applications:

1. Zig Version Selection:
   - Always specify a specific Zig version (zig_0_11, zig_0_12, zig_0_13, zig_0_14)
   - Check build.zig for minimum Zig version requirements

2. zig.hook automatically handles build, check, and install phases

3. Dependencies are usually fetched and hashed similar to Go/Rust

4. Common Build Flags:
   - -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe (default, with safety checks)
   - -Doptimize=ReleaseFast (faster, no safety)
   - -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall (smallest binary)
   - -Dcpu=baseline (better compatibility than native)

5. C Library Dependencies:
   - Use pkg-config in nativeBuildInputs
   - Add C libraries to buildInputs
   - Zig can link with C libraries seamlessly

6. Testing:
   - Tests run by default with zigCheckPhase
   - Disable with dontUseZigCheck = true
   - Use zigCheckFlags for test-specific flags

9. Advanced Features:
   - Override optimization with custom zig.hook
   - Use finalAttrs pattern for self-references
   - Multiple outputs supported (out, man, doc, etc.)
