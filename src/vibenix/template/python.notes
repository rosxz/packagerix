Important notes for packaging Python projects:

1. Use buildPythonApplication for executables, buildPythonPackage for libraries
2. Check pyproject.toml, setup.py, or setup.cfg to determine the build system
3. Modern projects with pyproject.toml: set pyproject = true;
4. Legacy projects: set format = "setuptools"; (or other format)
5. Dependencies: 
   - build-system: build-time dependencies (setuptools, poetry-core, hatchling, etc.)
   - dependencies: runtime dependencies
   - nativeCheckInputs: test dependencies
6. Common test frameworks: pytestCheckHook (preferred), unittestCheckHook
7. If tests fail due to network access or sandboxing, either:
   - Disable specific tests: pytestFlagsArray = [ "-k 'not test_network'" ];
   - Disable all tests: doCheck = false;
8. For projects using poetry: add poetry-core to build-system
9. For projects using hatch: add hatchling to build-system

Note: You have to use pythonImportsCheck to make sure you did not miss any mandatory dependencies.
