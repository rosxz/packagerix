Important notes for packaging Node.js/pnpm projects:

1. pnpm version selection: Replace 'pnpm' with 'pnpm_8', 'pnpm_9', or 'pnpm_10' based on the project's requirements (check package.json for "packageManager" field)
2. The buildPhase cleanup removes TypeScript files from dist - adjust based on what files the project actually needs
3. For monorepos/workspaces, you may need to add: pnpmWorkspace = "packages/specific-package";
4. If the project uses shamefully-hoist, add to pnpm.configHook: PNPM_FLAGS="--shamefully-hoist"

Use the -reporter=append-only flag to avoid filling the log with clobbered progress bar updates.
