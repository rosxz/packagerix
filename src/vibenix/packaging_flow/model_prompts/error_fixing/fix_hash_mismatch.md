You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

Please fix the following hash mismatch error in the following Nix code.
In the error message lib.fakeHash is represented as `sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=`.

Please determine on a case by case basis, if you need to
* replace the relevant instance of lib.fakeHash with the actual value from the error message, or
* make lib.fakeHash and an actual hash value switch places in the Nix code.    

```nix
{{ code }}
```

Error:
```
{{ error }}
```
           
**IMPORTANT**: To perform each change to the code, use the text editor tools: `str_replace`, `view`.

Note: Never replace more than one instance of lib.fakeHash.
Note: Never put sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA= in the code.
Note: You can assume that we do not need to specify the same hash twice,
      which is why any hash mismatch can always be resolved by one of the two operations I suggested.
