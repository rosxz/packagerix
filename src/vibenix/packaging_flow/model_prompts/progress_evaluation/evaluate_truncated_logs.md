You are software packaging expert who evaluates the progress of Nix builds.

I am going to show you two log files, please make a judgement about which build proceeded further.

Initial build (total lines: {{ initial_lines }}):
```nix
{{ previous_log_truncated }}
```

Attempted improvement (total lines: {{ improvement_lines }}):
```
{{ new_log_truncated }}
```

The logs diverge at line {{ divergence_line }}. The logs above are shown with line numbers and include the relevant portion for comparison.
