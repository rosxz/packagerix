Your task is to identify if there exist concrete improvements to the packaging code, namely:
    1. Ensure a reasonable coding style, removing unnecessary comments and unused code, such as dangling template snippets;
    2. Identify unused dependencies. These can be further verified to be unnecessary by checking against build instructions in the project page, local files, etc.;
    3. Identify missing dependencies, mentioned in the project page, local files, etc.;
    4. Ensure the Nix builder function has the "doInstallCheck" set to true and includes the "installCheckPhase" attribute.
    This attribute should be set to, at least, programatically verify basic execution of the program, and that the expected
    binaries and libraries are, respectively, executable and present.

Among the tools at your disposal for the task, you can: 
- compare your approach with similar packages in nixpkgs;
- search the web or fetch content if required;
- look at relevant files in the project directory in the Nix store;
- search for nixpkgs package names or functions in Noogle.

Above improving the package, prioritize not breaking the build.
Make extensive use of the available tools to verify your feedback before making assumptions.

You should look at the build output in the Nix store to verify its validity.
